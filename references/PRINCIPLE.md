# Principle

## Key Conventions

- Favor straightforward, minimal implementations first and add complexity only when it is requested or clearly required.
- Keep tasks tightly scoped to the requested outcome. Avoid scope creep.
- Tasks are the primary unit of work. Each task represents a coherent piece of work that maps to a Git PR.
- Subtasks are the individual steps within a task. Each subtask maps to a Git commit.
- A Jira ticket link is optional. Multiple tasks can reference the same ticket.

## Folder Structure

All tequila-managed artifacts are organized in the `.tequila/` folder at the project root. The key folder under it is `tasks/`.

- `.tequila/work`: (required) Contains the task-id of the currently focused task (e.g., `0001-add-multi-factor-auth`). This file tracks which task is actively being worked on. Actions should default to operating on this task.

### Tasks

The folder `.tequila/tasks/` contains the tasks that describe units of work to be done.

Each task is stored in its own subfolder named after its unique task id (`.tequila/tasks/{task-id}/`).
Task ids start with a 4-digit zero-padded auto-incrementing index prefix, followed by a kebab-case, verb-led descriptive part, e.g., `0001-add-multi-factor-auth`, `0002-improve-payment-latency`, or `0003-add-project-dashboard`. Prefer verb prefixes like `add-`, `remove-`, `update-`, `improve-`, *etc.*, to indicate the action being proposed. The index is determined by scanning existing task directories under `.tequila/tasks/`, finding the highest numeric prefix, and incrementing by 1. If no tasks exist, start at `0001`.
The corresponding task names are of the same wording (without the index prefix) but in Title Case, e.g., `Add Multi-Factor Auth`, `Improve Payment Latency`, or `Add Project Dashboard`.

- `.tequila/tasks/{task-id}/state`: (required)
  The state document for the task `{task-id}`, containing its current state only.
  Possible states are literally `PROPOSED`, `PLANNED`, `IMPLEMENTED`, `FAILED`, and `ARCHIVED`.
  See policies in the **Task Lifecycle** section of this document.
- `.tequila/tasks/{task-id}/ticket`: (optional)
  The ticket file for the task `{task-id}`, containing the Jira ticket index only (e.g., `PROJ-123`).
  Created when the user provides a Jira ticket index during the proposal.
- `.tequila/tasks/{task-id}/proposal.md`: (required, follows [TASKS-PROPOSAL.md](../assets/templates/TASKS-PROPOSAL.md))
  The main proposal document for the task `{task-id}`, outlining the motivation, goals, and high-level approach.
- `.tequila/tasks/{task-id}/subtasks.md`: (required after `PLANNED`, follows [TASKS-SUBTASKS.md](../assets/templates/TASKS-SUBTASKS.md))
  The subtask list for the task `{task-id}`.
  Subtasks are actionable items to be completed as part of implementing the task.
  Use task list grammar (e.g., `- [ ]` for pending subtasks and `- [x]` for completed subtasks) to track progress.
- `.tequila/tasks/{task-id}/design.md`: (optional, follows [TASKS-DESIGN.md](../assets/templates/TASKS-DESIGN.md))
  The design document for the task `{task-id}`.
  This document provides a detailed design and rationale for the task.
- `.tequila/tasks/{task-id}/validation.md`: (required after `IMPLEMENTED`, follows [VALIDATION.md](../assets/templates/VALIDATION.md))
  The validation document for the task `{task-id}`.
  This document describes how to validate the task, the expected outcome, and the result (PASS or FAIL).
  The validation method must be clear, unambiguous, and reproducible.
- `.tequila/tasks/{task-id}/issues.md`: (required if `FAILED`, follows [DOCUMENT-ISSUES.md](../assets/templates/DOCUMENT-ISSUES.md))
  The issues document for the task `{task-id}`.
  This document records the issues found, their root causes, and suggested fixes.
- `.tequila/tasks/{task-id}/*`: (optional)
  Any additional files related to the task `{task-id}`, such as diagrams or supporting documents.

## Task Lifecycle

Each task goes through a defined lifecycle with specific states. The state must be included in the `state` file within each task folder. The possible states are: `PROPOSED`, `PLANNED`, `IMPLEMENTED`, `FAILED`, and `ARCHIVED`. The normal progression is `PROPOSED → PLANNED → IMPLEMENTED → ARCHIVED`, and a task cannot skip any state in the forward direction. A task can enter the `FAILED` state from any active state (`PROPOSED`, `PLANNED`, or `IMPLEMENTED`) when issues are found. Once resolved, a `FAILED` task can be moved back to any previous active state depending on the nature of the failure.

### Proposed

In this state, the state file contains the text `PROPOSED` only.

The state indicates that the task has been proposed and is ready for planning.
The task folder must contain at least the `state` and `proposal.md` files in this state.

By reading the `proposal.md` file, stakeholders can understand the motivation and goals. Then, designated engineers can plan the implementation and create the `subtasks.md` and `design.md` files accordingly to move the task to the next state of `PLANNED`.

### Planned

In this state, the state file contains the text `PLANNED` only.

The state indicates that the task has been planned with a defined set of subtasks and is ready for implementation.
The task folder must contain the `subtasks.md` file in this state and optionally the `design.md` file for a more comprehensive approach, in addition to the files required in the `PROPOSED` state.

By reading the `subtasks.md` and `design.md` files, engineers can understand the specific subtasks to be completed and the design approach. Then, designated engineers can proceed with the implementation to move the task to the next state of `IMPLEMENTED`.

### Implemented

In this state, the state file contains the text `IMPLEMENTED` only.

The state indicates that the task has been implemented and is ready for validation.
The task folder must contain the `subtasks.md` file where all subtasks are marked completed in this state. Task list grammar is used for subtasks, e.g., `- [x]` for completed subtasks and `- [ ]` for pending subtasks.
The task folder must also contain the `validation.md` file documenting the validation method, steps, expected outcome, and result.

By reviewing the implementation and validation results, designated engineers can verify that the task has been successfully completed. Once verified, the task can be moved to the final state of `ARCHIVED`.

### Failed

In this state, the state file contains the text `FAILED` only.

The state indicates that issues have been found in the task that need to be addressed before proceeding.
The task folder must contain the `issues.md` file documenting the issues, their root causes, and suggested fixes.

A `FAILED` task can be moved back to its previous state (e.g., `PROPOSED`, `PLANNED`, or `IMPLEMENTED`) once the issues have been resolved and the `issues.md` file has been updated accordingly.

### Archived

In this state, the state file contains the text `ARCHIVED` only.

The state indicates that the task has been completed and archived for historical reference.
